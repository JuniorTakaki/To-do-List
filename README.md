# To-Do List App

This is a basic To-Do List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them from the list. The application also utilizes local storage to persist tasks between sessions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/JuniorTakaki/To-do-List>
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to use the To-Do List app.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Add, mark as completed, and remove tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are stored locally, allowing users to persist their to-do list between sessions.
- **Simple Design:** A clean and straightforward interface for easy task management.

## How It Works

1. The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript logic for the To-Do List application.
2. Users can input tasks in the text box and add them to the list.
3. Clicking on a task marks it as completed, and clicking on the "x" removes the task.
4. Tasks are stored in local storage, providing persistence across page reloads.
